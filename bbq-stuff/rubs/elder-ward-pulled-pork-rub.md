## The Rub

- 2 Tbs. kosher salt (NEVER use iodized salt, it ruins stuff)
- 2 Tbs. sugar (I prefer Hawaii raw when I can get it.)
- 2 Tbs. brown sugar
- 2 Tbs. ground cumin seed
- 2 Tbs. chili powder (pure not with garlic etc. added)
- 2 Tbs. cracked black pepper
- 1 Tbs. cayenne pepper (there is no substitute)
- 4 Tbs. Hungarian paprika
- 2 Tbs. ground sage (my secret ingredient) 

Makes 1 cup

Blend all.
