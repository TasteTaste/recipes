The Traditional North Carolina Sauce (A) I grew up with.

This would be from my mothers side of the family who are a bunch of flatlanders near the coast.  We only came down out of the hills to see them just enough to keep the peace in the family and my mother from running back home for good.  She hated the mountains.  We all loved her folks.

- 1 C cider vinegar
- 1 Tbs. sugar (Hawaii style when you can)
- 1 Tbs. cayenne pepper (fresh ones split 2 of em instead soak 2 days or more is best)
- 1 Tbs. Tabasco sauce
