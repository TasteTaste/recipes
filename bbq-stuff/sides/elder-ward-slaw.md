This needs to be made 12 or more hours ahead of time, not that it isn't good or eatable when fresh, its just not right.

## Mary Lee's, "I Fought the Slaw and The Slaw Won"

These are from the Jack Daniel's old time Barbecue cookbook by Vince Staten. (with an Elder Ward twist)

- 3 LBS. cabbage
- 3 ribs of celery
- 1 onion (yellow)
- 1 bell pepper
- 3 carrots
- 2 C sugar (Hawaiian when you can get it.)

Shred, chop or dice all and mix with sugar. Set cabbage mixture aside.

- 1/2 Cup of white vinegar
- 1/2 Cup of Apple Cider vinegar
- 1/2 C olive oil (my twist)
- 1 tsp celery seed
- 1 tsp (kosher salt)

Bring all to a boil and pour over cabbage mixture and chill overnight.
