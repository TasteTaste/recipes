Myron Mixon's Killer Potato Salad

Serves 8

2 pounds red-skinned new potatoes
1 cup sour cream
1 teaspoon dried dill
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/3 cup chopped fresh chives
1 cup mayonnaise
1 tablespoon coarsely-ground black pepper
1 tablespoon salt
6 hard-boiled eggs, chopped
Favorite barbecue rub, for garnish

Wash the potatoes well. In a large heavy pot, bring water to a boil. Add the potatoes and boil for 15 to 20 minutes, or until they are tender, being careful not to overcook them, as you don't want them mushy.

Drain the potatoes in a colander, and run cold water over them to stop them from continuing to cook. Let them cool in the colander.

Slice the potatoes into thin rounds, leaving the skin on. Set aside.

In a medium bowl, combine the sour cream, dill, garlic powder, onion powder, chives, mayonnaise, pepper, and salt. Stir well.

In a large bowl, toss the potatoes with the chopped eggs and the sour cream dressing. Cover the bowl and chill in the refrigerator for 2 hours before serving. Sprinkle the top with your favorite barbecue rub (of course Mixon recommends his own brand, Jack's Old South Original Rub, which he sells on his website) before serving, if you like.

Ingredients

        2 pounds red potatoes, sliced
        1/2 cup mayonnaise, preferably Duke's
        1/4 cup buttermilk
        2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives
        1/2 cup shredded sharp cheddar
        10 slices thin-cut bacon, cooked and crumbled

Preparation

Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the potatoes and reduce to a simmer. Cook the potatoes until they are tender.

Rinse the cooked potatoes under cold water to cool. Drain and add them to a medium bowl.

In a separate bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, buttermilk, chives, cheddar and bacon. Add the potatoes to the mayonnaise mixture and stir to coat evenly.
