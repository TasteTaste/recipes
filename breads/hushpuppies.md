Typically halve

- 1 Tbsp unsalted butter
- 1 cup buttermilk
- 2 eggs
- 1 onion
- 1 tsp pepper
- 2 tsp salt
- 3 tsp baking powder
- 1/4 tsp baking soda
- 1/3 cup sugar
- 1 cup all purpose flour
- 2 cups cornmeal

Combine all ingredients except the oil.  Peanut oil is my favorite to cook this in and here is the important part, make sure the oil is hot enough to evaporate a drop of water when it is dropped in the oil. You must use high heat and never cook too much at one time or it will cool the oil and the hush puppies will be soggy. :~(
When the oil reaches temperature, take a teaspoon and scoop enough dough mixture to create a ball that is just a hair to big to eat in one bite.  Carefully drop this into the oil.  When it floats and is golden brown, use a wire strainer to lift out of the oil and place on paper towels to drain.  Break the first couple open to be sure that they are done inside if not cook a little longer this is a feel thing but not hard to get.  (THIS IS THE LAST THING YOU DO BEFORE YOU EAT AS THEY ARE AT THEIR BEST PIPING HOT AND GO DOWN HILL FROM THAT POINT ON.) They are not bad cold or cool just not great.

One last thing, here is my twist.  If you're a chili head, or as we us to say, a real man, try chopping up 1 jalape√±o pepper, seed and all, per cup of dough, or if company has a mild taste, fix half with half without.  Boy howdy!
