Halve for two people. I always just make everything and cook on the same day. Whipping the egg whites sounds finicky, but it's not. 

Also have just used all buttermilk when didn't have sour cream and turned out good.

Basic Dry Pancake Mix:
- 10 ounces (about 2 cups) all purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 tablespoon sugar

For Each Batch of Pancakes
- 2 large eggs, separated
- 1 1/2 cups (about 12 ounces) buttermilk
- 1 cup (about 8 ounces) sour cream (see note)
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus more for serving
- Warm maple syrup


1. For the Dry Pancake Mix: Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar in a medium bowl and whisk until homogenous.Transfer to an airtight container.The mix will stay good for 3 months. (See note.)

2. For each Batch of Pancakes: Place one batch of dry mix in a large bowl. In a medium clean bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff peaks form. In a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks, buttermilk, and sour cream until homogenous. Slowly drizzle in the melted butter while whisking (I often just leave out the butter, find it makes them lighter/fluffier). Carefully fold in the egg whites with a rubber spatula until just combined. Pour the mixture over the dry mix and fold until just combined (there should still be plenty of lumps).

3. Heat a large heavy-bottomed nonstick skillet over medium heat for 5 minutes (or use an electric griddle). Add a small amount of butter or oil to the griddle and spread with a paper towel until no visible butter or oil remains. Use a 1‚ÅÑ4-cup dry measure to place 4 pancakes in the skillet and cook until bubbles start to appear on top and the bottoms are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Carefully flip the pancakes and cook on the second side until golden brown and completely set, about 2 minutes longer. Serve the pancakes immediately, or keep warm on a wire rack set on a rimmed baking sheet in a warm oven while you cook the remaining 3 batches. Serve with warm maple syrup and butter.
