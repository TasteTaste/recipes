This recipe is based on Creamy Jalapeno dip from Chuy's Comida Deluxe.

Ingredient list:

- 1 cup mayo
- 1 cup buttermilk
- 1 packet of Hidden Valley Ranch Buttermilk Recipe
- 1 jar pickled sliced jalapenos
- 1 bunch fresh cilantro
- 1 small can chipotles in adobo
- 2 tbsp aji amarillo paste
- 1 tsp lime juice
- 1/4 tsp arbol chile oil (as required)

Procedure:

1. Split open and remove seeds and pith from 1-3 chipotles. Rinse to remove sauce
2. Remove stems from cilantro and clean leaves
3. Drain vinegar from jar of jalapenos
4. Combine jalapenos, cilantro, and chipotle in food processor and, in 2-4 stages, process down to diced/minced texture. Use a spatula to push chunks down off the sides of the bowl between stages. Do not puree.
5. Transfer processed ingredients to large bowl
6. Add mayo, buttermilk, ranch powder, and aji amarillo to bowl
7. Gently combine ingredients with whisk
8. Add lime juice to taste
9. Adjust heat level with arbol oil, with caution
10. Chill in refrigerator to allow flavors to marry. 12-24 hours works best. The dip will get significantly hotter after 24 hours, and gradually hotter over the next few days.

Dip will keep for about 2 weeks
