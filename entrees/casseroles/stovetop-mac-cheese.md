## Stovetop Mac and Cheese

Riff off of [Bacon-Jalapeño Stovetop Mac and Cheese Recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/10/bacon-jalapeno-stovetop-macaroni-and-cheese-recipe.html)

## Ingredients

### Standard Mac and Cheese

- 1/2 pound elbow macaroni
- 1 (5-ounce) can evaporated milk
- 1 large egg
- 1/2 teaspoon Frank’s RedHot or other hot sauce
- 1/2 teaspoon ground mustard (Coleman's)
- 1/2 pound extra-sharp cheddar cheese, grated
- 4 ounces American cheese, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- 1/2 tablespoon cornstarch
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
    
### Mix-ins
- 4 oz of pancetta or bacon (pancetta better with chipotles to not add too much smoke)
- 1 red or green jalapeño peppers, seeds and ribs removed, finely minced or
- 1 chipotle pepper in adobo (rinsed for less hot) or
- 1 tablespoon of minced pickled jalapeño
    
Note: choose mix-ins based on desired heat level, I actually like this dish less hot with pancetta, rinsed chipotle pepper and pickled jalapeño

## Steps

1. Cook bacon/panchetta in a medium skillet over medium heat, stirring, until completely crisp, about 8 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in chipotle/jalapeños, scraping up browned bits from bottom of pan. Set aside. Remove some of mixture to a separate small bowl and reserve for garnish.
2. Place macaroni in a large saucepan and cover it with salted water by 2 inches. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally to keep pasta from sticking. Cover pan, remove from heat, and let stand until pasta is barely al dente, about 8 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, whisk together evaporated milk, eggs, hot sauce, and mustard in a bowl until homogeneous. Toss cheeses with cornstarch in a large bowl until thoroughly combined.
4. When pasta is cooked, drain it and return it to saucepan (reserve a bit of pasta water if needs thinning). Place over low heat, add butter, and stir until melted. Add mix-in mixture (including rendered fat), milk mixture, and cheese mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until cheese is completely melted and mixture is hot and creamy. Season to taste with salt and more hot sauce (typically not needed) . Serve immediately, topped with reserved mix-in mixture.
