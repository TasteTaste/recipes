- doubled cayenne pepper
- used chicken stock to deglaze pot

When it came time to add the chicken stock and tomatoes, simply turning off the IP didn't reduce the temperature fast enough. I used the chicken stock to deglaze the bottom of the pot, but the IP remained too hot so I stirred in the tomatoes to cool things off. This resulted in the sauce being a little too thick/"dry" to be able to bring the IP up to pressure before the food would have burned. I added about another 1/2 cup of chicken stock and tried again. This worked fine but required about 30 minutes of simmering to reduce the sauce back to a good thickness after the chicken was cooked.

Recommendations:

- Turn off sear mode immediately before adding ginger and garlic
- Use 1/2c chicken stock instead of 1/3c
- Consider adding the optional sugar/honey
