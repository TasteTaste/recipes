This is has been a long standing "go to" weeknight meal, everything except the chicken are typically pantry items for us. I've made it enough I no longer refer to a recipe, so this is my attempt at writing down the current evolution. If we don't have chicken, we live close by to an awesome Italian market in town called Bagliani's, so Joseph will often just scoot over to "Bags" and pick up a pack of chicken cutlets to use which is nice and convenient. You could also just get chicken breasts and cut them into cutlets however you're feeling, I don't ever bother pounding them out, but you could if you wanted to. Bagliani's also has house Italian breadcrumbs, but any good seasoned breadcrumbs will do. And then, while the white wine adds some flavor, it's totally not needed and I often make it just with chicken broth. Finally, while there's measurements for the flour and breadcrumbs, I never measure it out, I just put a light layer in the pans and add as I go to minimize waste. 

This began as a merging of two different recipes

Ingredients

    4-6 chicken breast cutlets
    1 cup (approx) all purpose flour
    2 eggs
    1 cup (approx) seasoned Italian breadcrumbs
    Kosher salt
    Fresh ground black pepper
    Olive oil
    1/4 cup dry white wine
    3/4 cup chicken broth
    2 tbsp unsalted butter
    1-2 tbsp of capers (drained)
    juice of 1/2 lemon
    Chopped fresh parsley leaves (for serving)

Instructions

    Get three pans or bowls for dredging the chicken, I use pyrex pie pans. The dredge goes flour, eggs and then breadcrumbs. So flour in the first one, whisk the eggs with 1-2 tbps of water and put in the second one, breadcrumbs in the third one.

    For each cutlet:
        - Sprinkle with kosher salt and black pepper
        - Coat in flour, typically I have a light layer in the pie pan, sprinkle more flour on top and use tongs to get an even coat
        - Then coat in eggs, making sure there's full coverage
        - Lastly, coat in breadcrumbs

    If you're feeling good about your coating technique, you can start getting the pan hot and cook them while assembly lining the other cutlets. But it's complete fine to do all of them and set them on a plate/tray and then move to cooking them.

    To cook, use a large skillet and add enough olive oil to cover the bottom. Heat the olive oil until shimmering and gently lower the cutlets into the pan. Once the bottom is browned and crisp (~3 minutes) flip over and cook the other side until is done (~3 minutes). Transfer to a tray, paper towels option to absorb any extra oil. 

    Once all of the chicken is done, deglaze the pan with the white wine, pouring it in and whisking any brown bits off the bottom of the pan. Then add the chicken broth. If not using wine, can do this is with the chicken broth directly.

    Let the chicken broth boil to reduce to about half (2-5 minutes). Then add in the butter, whisking while it melts so it emulsifies. Once the butter is incorporated, add the lemon juice and capers and turn off the heat.

    To serve, put 1-2 cutlets per person on a plate, spoon sauce from pan over them, sprinkle with parsley. Can also serve with a slice of lemon.  

    This dish greatly benefits from warming the plates, so if you have good way to do that, do that when you start cooking (we put them in the oven on low heat). 

    Enjoy!
