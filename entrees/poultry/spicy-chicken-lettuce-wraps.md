Ingredients

2 Tbsp. soy sauce

1 Tbsp. dark brown sugar

1 tsp. fish sauce

1 Tbsp. sambal oelek or Sriracha, plus more for serving

2 Tbsp. vegetable oil

3 scallions, white and pale green parts only, thinly sliced

2 garlic cloves, finely chopped

1 lb. ground chicken

Kosher salt

Bibb lettuce leaves, lime wedges, and tender herbs (for serving)

Preparation

    Step 1

    Mix soy sauce, brown sugar, fish sauce, and 1 Tbsp. sambal oelek in a small bowl; set aside.
    Step 2

    Heat oil in a skillet over medium. Add scallions and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened (a little color is okay), about 3 minutes. Add chicken and lightly season with salt. Cook, breaking up with a wooden spoon and tossing occasionally, until chicken is cooked through, 5â€“7 minutes. Add reserved soy sauce mixture and cook, tossing occasionally, until liquid is almost completely reduced, about 2 minutes.
    Step 3

    Serve chicken mixture with lettuce, herbs, lime wedges, and more sambal oelek for making lettuce wraps.


Notes: have made with ground beef, ground pork, ground turkey - all tasty
