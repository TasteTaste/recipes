Ingredients

For the sauce:

    1 1/4 teaspoons sugar

    1/4 teaspoon black pepper

    2 tablespoons oyster sauce

    2 tablespoons light soy sauce

    2 1/2 tablespoons canola oil

    3 garlic cloves, minced

    2-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely shredded

    3 scallions, green part only, chopped

For the steamed salmon

    1 scallion, white part only, cut lengthwise into strips

    1 1/4 pounds salmon fillet, cut crosswise into 2 pieces

    4 sprigs cilantro

Directions

    For the sauce: In a small bowl, combine the sugar, pepper, oyster sauce, and soy sauce. Stir until the sugar is dissolved. Pour the oil into a small saucepan, and turn the heat to medium. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 15 seconds. Add the ginger and cook until it is also fragrant, about one minute. Pour in the sauce, stir well, and wait for it to come to a boil. Then add the scallions, turn off the heat, and stir to combine. Set aside.

    For the steamed salmon: Fill a large pot with a steamer tray halfway up with water, and bring to a boil.

    Meanwhile, find a heatproof plate or nonreactive cake or pie pan that will hold the salmon fillets and will also fit in the steamer tray with about 1 inch left around the edges. Toss half of the white scallion strips into the pan, and then place the salmon fillets on top. Pour the sauce on top of the salmon.

    Transfer the pan to the steamer tray. Cover the pot, and cook until fish is cooked, 8 to 10 minutes. A knife should be able to be inserted into the thicket part of the flesh easily. When done, turn off the heat, and carefully remove the pan with the fish.

    Transfer the fish to a platter and pour the sauce and juices on top. Garnish with the remaining scallion strips and the cilantro. 

Note: typically don't use oyster sauce, 1tbps mirin and 1tbps fish sauce has been a good substitute
