## Galbi (갈비구이)

A Korean classic

## Ingredients

### Marinade

- 1 large asian pear, or 1.5 small ones, pealed (some say you can use other types of pear, I think it never quite tastes right)
- 1/2 white onion
- 6-8 cloves of garlic
- 2-3 green onions
- 1 inch knob of ginger, pealed
- 1/3 c of soy sauce
- Several good grinds of black pepper (1 tsp or so)

Using a food processor, blend the above until it creates a grainy liquid, add:

- 1 tbsp of mirin
- 1 tbsp of fish sauce
- 2 tbsp of brown sugar

Blend well, add:

- 1-2 tbsp of roasted seasame oil

Blend at low speed until incorporated

### Meat

I prefer the "flanken" or "LA" style beef short ribs, mainly because it's easier. The chunk style can be used, see [Maangchi's recipe](https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/galbi) on how to cut them.
9 flanken ribs are typically good for two people, typically there's enough marinade for twice that amount.

## Steps

Put the meat and marinade in an appropriately sized container (or freezer bags work well too). Marinate at least 8 hours, overnight is even better.

Make a charcoal grill super hot, grill until nicely charred on each side. Cut strips off of bone and serve with ssam sauce; rice and lettuce if you want wraps.
