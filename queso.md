## Queso (and varieties)

Velveeta and Rotel never tastes as good as imagined, but "real" queso also should't try too hard to be "real" cheese. The point here is a creamy, emulsified cheese dip that can take all kinds of mixins depending on the mood. The base is built using evaporated milk, american cheese, and touch of cornstarch ([for the reasons](http://aht.seriouseats.com/2010/09/the-burger-lab-cheese-sauce-for-burgers-fries-and-chips.html)).

## Ingredients

### Core
- 5 oz can of evaporated milk (not condensed which is sweet!)
- 1/4 lb of american cheese from the deli (in a large chunk if you can get it, in a pinch you can use kraft singles, but the deli stuff is typically creamier)
- 1/2 tsp of cornstarch 

### Mix and Match
- 1 poblano chili, charred and skin removed
- 1 chipotle chili in adobo, rinsed, seeded, and diced
- 1/2 tsp of adobo sauce
- Garlic, minced
- Cilantro

## Steps
If using chilies/garlic heat a bit of oil and saute until fragrant. 
Dice cheese and toss in cornstarch until evenly dusted.
Pour in half of evaporated milk and heat until simmering.
Reduce heat and add cheese, leaving any extra cornstarch behind.
Whisk until melted, keeping it at a simmer or below.
Add evaporated milk as needed for desired consistency, amount depends on water content of chilies and chese. 
Top with cilantro and serve with tortilla chips. 
Best if served in pot or preheated bowl. 
If serving for a party some form of crock pot is needed as it will solidify as it cools. 

Other mixin ideas include rotel, jalape√±os, bacon, taco meat...
