hand smash 3 of those cans of tomatoes, removing basil chunks

melt 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil and 4 tablespoons butter in a large dutch oven over medium heat

add 8 cloves minced garlic and 1 thin sliced shallot, stir until soft and fragrant (2 mins)

add 1/2 tbsp hot paprika, 1 tbsp dried oregano, and 1 tbsp fresh cracked black pepper, stir until fragrant (1 min)

preheat oven to 275-300

add (3 cans hand smashed) tomatoes, 1 or 2 whole peeled carrots chopped into large chunks, half a peeled white onion, one big sprig of fresh basil, 1c low/no salt chicken stock (optional)

bring to simmer over high heat

transfer to oven (250-300, goal is lowest temp that simmers the sauce and leads to browning at the edges)

stir every 1-2 hours until reduced to about 50% original volume - 6-9 hours total. You'll know when it's ready - if you think it's not ready, it's not ready. Scrape the browned bits off the sides of the pot down into the sauce and stir in, that is the good stuff.

30 minutes prior to removing sauce from oven: mince 1/2c fresh parsley and 1/2c fresh basil

open 4th can of tomatoes, dump into small bowl, and use immersion blender (or whatever is available) to puree contents

remove sauce from oven, pull out carrots/onions/basil with tongs and discard .. some sauce will be lost here, but every good outcome has some shades of grey

add puree'd tomatoes

optionally, add vodka (1/4c per quart, this recipe is about 2 quarts = 1/2c vodka) (caveat: I have never actually added the vodka)

add 2 tsp (teaspoon!) fish sauce, 1 tsp soy sauce, 1 tsp worchestershire sauce, parsley and basil from above, salt and pepper to taste, additional olive oil to taste

return to oven for 10-15 minutes

Complete!

At this point I measure out 1-cup portions of sauce into tupperware to put into the freezer. Generally get 7 or 8 cups. If you have a really huge dutch oven you might be able to 1.5x or 2x the recipe.
