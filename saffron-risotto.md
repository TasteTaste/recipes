## Saffron Risotto (with Seafood)

Easier than it sounds risotto derived from [Cooking Light's Seafood Risotto for Two](http://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/seafood-risotto-1)

## Ingredients

### Standard
- 2 1/2 cups low/no-sodium chicken broth 
- 1/2 cups dry white wine
- 1 tbsp butter
- 1/4 cup diced shallot
- 1/2 cup uncooked Carnaroli (preferred) or Arborio rice
- 1/8 tsp saffron threads, crushed
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- 1/2 grape tomatoes, halved
- Fresh parsley (any type), chopped

### Mix and Match
Some form of seafood, e.g.:
- 8oz medium shrimp, peeled and deveined

or

- 4-8 sea scallops

## Steps
Put rice in mesh strainer and swish in the broth and wine to wash starch off of rice into the broth. 
This helps make a creamer result, see: [The Food Lab: The Road To Better Risotto](http://www.seriouseats.com/2011/10/the-food-lab-the-science-of-risotto.html)

Bring broth and wine to a simmer in a medium saucepan (do not boil). Keep warm over low heat.

Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. 
Add shallots to pan (or than 1/4c is fine); cook 2 minutes or until tender, stirring frequently. 
Add rice and saffron to pan; cook 30 seconds or until a bit toasty, stirring constantly. 
Add lemon juice to pan; cook 15 seconds, stirring constantly.

Stir in 1/2 cup hot broth mixture; cook 2 minutes or until the liquid is nearly absorbed, stirring constantly. 
Add remaining broth mixture, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly until each portion of broth is absorbed before adding the next.
In theory you could just add all of the broth at once (see above article), but I like the meditative process of stirring the risotto.
Make sure the last amount of broth is fairly well absorbed because the next step of adding tomatoes will add some liquid back.

At this point, add salt to taste.

Stir in tomatoes; cook until wilted (~1-2 minutes). 
If using shrimp or similar seafood mixin, add to risotto and cooked, stirring occasionally until done. 
If using sea scallops, sear and set aside to plate on top.  

Remove from heat. Plate on pre-heated plates, sprinkle with parsley and finishing salt.
