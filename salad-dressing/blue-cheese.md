## Blue Cheese Dressing

The key here is to use a good blue cheese, have most enjoyed Bleu d'Auvergne. It is nice and creamy while still having a strong blue cheese flavor. This is a fairly thick dressing originally called a [dip](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/02/blue-cheese-dip-sauce-recipe.html).

## Ingredients

- 1/4 pound blue cheese
- 1/2 cup mayonnaise
- 1/4 cup sour cream
- Juice of 1/2 lemon
- 1 tablespoon white vinegar

### Mix and Match
Original recipe called for seasoning with salt and pepper, have not found either to be necessary.

## Steps
Put the blue cheese in a bowl and mash with a fork until a paste forms. Whisk in the remaining ingredients until you have a smooth sauce.
