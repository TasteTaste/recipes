## Easy Caesar

The key here is to use a good quality mayo, either from scratch, Dukes, or Hellman's in a pinch.

## Ingredients

- 2/3 cup mayonnaise
- 1 medium clove of garlic
- 2 teaspoons of Worcestershire
- 1.5 oz of Parmigiano-Reggiano,
- 1/2 teaspoon of fish sauce
- 1 tablespoon of lemon juice

### Mix and Match

Shallots and black pepper can be good to add as well, have also subbed or mixed in pecorino cheese to good effect as well. I like fish sauce better than anchovies because it doesn't make the dressing become more fishy in the fridge as leftovers. 

## Steps
This is totally a "to taste" recipe. Put everything in a food processor, process, taste and adjust.
