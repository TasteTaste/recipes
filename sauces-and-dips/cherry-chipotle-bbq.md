- 1 1/2 cups roughly chopped frozen, pitted cherries
- 1/3 cup rice vinegar

Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and browned around the edges, about 7 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in ketchup, cherries, vinegar, brown sugar, orange juice, honey, molasses, chipotles in adobo, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, salt, adobo sauce, chili powder, black pepper, white pepper, and cayenne pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until slightly thickened, 15-20 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.

Puree sauce with an immersion blender, or transfer sauce to the jar of a standard blender, and process until smooth. Transfer to an airtight container and store in refrigerator for up to two months.
