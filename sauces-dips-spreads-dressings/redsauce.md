#### To do:

- Try adding sage
- Make ingredient list at top

#### Ingredients (for doubling the recipe)

- 1.5 90 oz cans tomatoes
- 1/2 cup olive oil
- 8 Tbsp butter
- 16 cloves of garlic
- 2 shallots
- 2 Tbsp dried oregano
- 2 Tbsp black pepper
- 2-4 carrots
- 1 white onion
- 1 or 2 big sprigs of basil
- 2 cups chicken stock
- 1 cup fresh parsley
- 1 cup fresh basil

#### The recipe:

- Obtain 4 28oz cans of certified DOP San Marzano whole peeled tomatoes (background here: http://slice.seriouseats.com/archives/2010/12/what-is-a-dop-italian-san-marzano-canned-tomato.html )

- hand smash 3 of those cans of tomatoes, removing basil chunks

- melt 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil and 4 tablespoons butter in a large dutch oven over medium heat

- add 8 cloves minced garlic and 1 thin sliced shallot, stir until soft and fragrant (2 mins)

- optionally add up to 1/2 tsp hot paprika - any more will be too hot for most uses, and heat can always be added later

- add 1 tbsp dried oregano and 1 tbsp fresh cracked black pepper, stir until fragrant (1 min)

- preheat oven to 275-300

- add (3 cans hand smashed) tomatoes, 1 or 2 whole peeled carrots chopped into large chunks, half a peeled white onion, one big sprig of fresh basil, and optionally 1c low/no salt chicken stock

- bring to simmer over high heat

- transfer to oven (250-300, goal is lowest temp that simmers the sauce and leads to browning at the edges)

- stir every 1-2 hours until reduced to about 50% original volume - 6-9 hours total. You'll know when it's ready - if you think it's not ready, it's not ready. Scrape the browned bits off the sides of the pot down into the sauce and stir in, that is the good stuff.

- 30 minutes prior to removing sauce from oven: mince 1/2c fresh parsley and 1/2c fresh basil

- open 4th can of tomatoes, dump into small bowl, and use immersion blender (or whatever is available) to puree contents

- remove sauce from oven, pull out carrots/onions/basil with tongs and discard .. some sauce will be lost here, but every good outcome has some shades of grey

- add puree'd tomatoes

- optionally, add vodka (1/4c per quart, this recipe is about 2 quarts = 1/2c vodka) (caveat: I have never actually added the vodka)

- add 2 tsp (teaspoon!) fish sauce, 1 tsp soy sauce, 1 tsp worchestershire sauce, parsley and basil from above, salt and pepper to taste, additional olive oil to taste

- return to oven for 10-15 minutes

Complete!

At this point I measure out 1-cup portions of sauce into ziploc bags to put into the freezer. Generally get 7 or 8 cups. If you have a really huge dutch oven you might be able to 1.5x or 2x the recipe.

31 mar 2019: doubled the recipe, used bigger allclad pot. Higher oven temp of 300 seemed required at the beginning. Eventually lowered temp to 270. Cook time is at least 12 hours.


10 nov 2018: made w/5 cans tomatoes, 1 cup chicken stock, 1/2 tsp hot paprika. Turned out very well, suggest removing hot paprika entirely. Opinion is this is the best version so far, possibly resulting from additional cooking time required by extra can of tomatoes.

31 dec 2017: made w/2 cups unsalted chicken stock, oven at 280, put in oven at 10:20 am
